          <h2>LBQ Support Forums</h2>
          <p>
            PYWV LBQ Support forum comprises of Lesbians, Bisexuals and Queer
            persons living with and affected by HIV from our community Dandora.
            The support forum came into existence because of the challenges the
            LBQ Womxn are facing such as:
            
            <ul>
              <li> Sexual Violence</li>
              <li>Disownment</li>
              <li>Stigma and
            discrimination based on Sexual Orientations and Expressions</li>
            </ul>
           
             
             This has
            led to significant health and social-economic negative outcomes on
            this group and this saw the beginning of this safe space created. It
            started on a WhatsApp group and still has weekly conversations on
            the group on key issues that are important to LBQ womxn. The monthly
            support forums have enabled:
            
            <ul>
              <li>The dissemination of LBQ tailored
              Sexual and reproductive health(SRH) Information to its members.</li>
              <li>Creation of linkages with services providing organizations that
              offer SRH services to our members.</li>
              <li> Creation of a safe space for LBQ
              womxn to meet monthly.</li>
              <li>Ensure security and protection of the human
              rights of Lesbian, Bisexual and Queer (LBQ) women.</li>
            </ul>
