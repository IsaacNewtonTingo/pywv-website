          <h2>PYWV 2022 – 2026 Strategic Plan</h2> <br> <hr> <br>

          <p>
            As Positive Young Women Voices marks five years since it was
            formally registered, we are delighted to be sharing our vision for
            the next five years with the world. Our 2022-2026 strategic plan
            seeks to: Promote uptake of sexual and reproductive health services
            for AGYW in all their diversities as measured by increased access to
            quality healthcare services. Promote the rights of AGYW in all their
            diversities through capacity building initiatives and stakeholder
            engagement. Equip AGYW with financial and entrepreneurship knowledge
            for improved livelihoods through investment in viable and
            sustainable economic opportunities for self-sufficiency. Strengthen
            PYWV’s profile and reputation to attract and sustain strategic
            partners through effective communication and visibility. Enhance
            PYWV’s effectiveness and efficiency to deliver on its mission
            through strengthening the internal systems and structures. We
            appreciate all our partners, current and to come for walking with us
            as we bring change for our girls and young women in our diversities.
