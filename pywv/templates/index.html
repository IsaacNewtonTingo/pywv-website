        <p>
          <span> Positive Young Women Voices (PYWV)</span> is a community based
          organization which started as a self-help group in the year 2014 but
          later registered as a community based organization in the year 2017.
          The idea of group formation was derived when these advocates noticed
          there were major challenges facing young women and girls living with
          and at risk of HIV within the Nairobi slums of Dandora.The major
          challenges include teenage pregnancy, poverty, gender based violence,
          access to friendly health facility and information.Armed with
          experience they chose to fill the gaps by offering mentorship, provide
          linkages and referrals, create awareness and offer information.

          <p>
            JJ had her first period when she was 14 years old and had just
            joined high school. She had been waiting for this and knew that it
            would happen as almost all girls in her last class in primary school
            had fuller chest and carried their sanitary towels when it was that
            time of the month.

          <h3>Ending violence against women and girls</h3>

          <p>
            Behind every woman and girl there is an untold story and in most
            case is a sad story. Women and girls go through various challenges
            in life; gender based violence being the most rampant. This is due
            to the patriarchal system and cultural factors that deny women power
            to decide on their human rights.
