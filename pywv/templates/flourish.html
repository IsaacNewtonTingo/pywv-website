          <h5>
            A Toolbox for Girls and Young Women Leaders on the Frontlines of
            Gender Justice in Health
          </h5>
          <p>
            This toolbox, FLOURISH, is a collection of programming, advocacy,
            leadership, and mentorship resources and information that inform the
            collective action of emerging girls and young women leaders pursuing
            gender justice in health. It can be used to design, implement,
            expand, and strengthen programmes and activities of girls and young
            women and helps enable practical, meaningful, and impactful advocacy
            and leadership work across a wide variety of settings. FLOURISH has
            been written and inspired by young women leaders all over the world,
            with leadership from partners including Positive Young Women Voices
            (PYWV), the Global Network of Young People Living with HIV (Y+
            Global), and the Africa Youth and Adolescent Network (AfriYAN). In
            supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, this toolbox
            is part of an important effort to find innovative solutions in
            various forms and ways of thinking towards empowering girls and
            young women and promoting real and sustainable change. In addition
            to helping build and support their capacities and skills, it also
            aims to raise awareness about the need for substantial investments
            in community-led organizations, groups, and networks of girls and
            young women in all their diversities. All local and global
            development partners should recognize and respond to the fact that
            such investments are essential for real change in all aspects of
            gender justice. At the heart of this toolbox is the belief that the
            substantive leadership of girls and young women must be encouraged
            at all levels if we are to achieve gender justice locally,
            nationally, and globally. Making significant progress toward this
            goal requires increasing and supporting their opportunities to shape
            policies and practices related to the health and rights of
            themselves, their peers, and communities â€“ including by holding
            governments, multilateral agencies, policy makers, programme
            managers, and other decision-makers to account. This type and scope
            of direct engagement is essential to ensure that gender equality
            commitments are translated into sustained and meaningful change in
            areas such as HIV prevention and treatment, human rights, and sexual
            and reproductive health.
