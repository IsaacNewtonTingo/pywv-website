                Lizz Abade is a resourceful customer service representative committed to and driven by the need
                to solve peopleâ€™s problems.
                She takes pride in providing exemplary service to everyone. She is a
                graduate of International relations and is most passionate about causes that pursue sustainable
                development in Africa; among them, gender equality. She reckons that the implications of not
                providing girls and women with equal voices, choices and opportunities affect not just their lives
                but the future of the planet. When she is not handling customers or pursuing development causes,
                she enjoys expressing herself creatively through her blog at lizzabade.wordpress.com.
