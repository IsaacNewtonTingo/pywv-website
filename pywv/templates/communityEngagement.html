          <p>
            We hold <strong>monthly community outreaches</strong>  and <strong>dialogues</strong>  on <strong>violence against women and girls in their diversity</strong> . Our outreaches are an avenue for us to listen, inform and respond to the needs of community members within the five phases in <strong>Dandora</strong> , all while creating  linkages with local authorities on SGBV response, raising awareness on our programmes  and offering referrals to SRH services for women and girls.    <strong>Community Dialogues</strong>     
             are structured forums derived from the outreaches, bringing together select members from the community to discuss peaceful means of solving conflicts, with a focus on preventing violence against women and girls in homes and within intimate partner relationships
