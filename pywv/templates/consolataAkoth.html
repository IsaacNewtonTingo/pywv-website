                I envision a world where; girls' (in all their diversity)voices are heard, women(in all their diversity) are bold enough to take up any and every role considered for men!, there's gender equity and every girl in all their diversity is proud to be a female, not afraid of their periods anymore, and grow to be empowered ladies!
