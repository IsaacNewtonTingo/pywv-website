            The aim of the mentorship is <strong>nurturing a community of bold female leaders</strong> , with the voice of change both at an individual and societal level.

            The mentorship department works closely with <strong>adolescent girls</strong>  of <strong>ages 9 to 19</strong>  years in 3 community high schools and out of school . The mentors in the department facilitate sessions on <strong>sexual reproductive health and rights including information access, adolescence and peer pressure, mental health and well being, menstrual hygiene, healthy communication and leadership skills</strong> . Boys are also engaged in the sessions in the schools we partner with as allies in ending period stigma. <br><br>

            The mentorship sessions run on a <strong>monthly basis,</strong>  with six sessions every month. We mark and celebrate the girls on occasions that call for it like International day of the girl child and Menstrual hygiene day marked globally. <br><br>
