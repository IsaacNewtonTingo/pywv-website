            We hold <strong>monthly conversations</strong>  on our <strong>social media platforms</strong>  aimed at creating awarenmness about <strong>Sexual and Reproductive Health issues</strong>  that affect women and girls in all their diversities.These conversations offer a platform for advocacy,knowledge sharing and also facilitate a safe space where people are able to share their experiences and ask questions without the fear of being judged.We are currently implementing a project dubbed <strong>#Voice4Impact</strong>  which is  a social media series with 10 episodes. We recognize that women’s rights advocates and human rights defenders rarely get the recognition and support that they deserve. It is to this regard that the  aim of the project is to give women’s rights advocates and human rights defenders a platform to share their work,their advocacy journeys,the challenges they face and most importantly it gives us a chance to celebrate the amazing work they are doing to create change in their communities.  <br><br>

            Additionally,we use our social media platforms to amplify the <strong>work we are doing in our community</strong> . This is done by sharing our activities and plans. We also share articles on our website that have been written by our team members.
